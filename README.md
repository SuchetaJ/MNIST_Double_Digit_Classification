# MNIST_Double_Digit_Classification

MNIST is a single digit dataset, constructed a double digit dataset by concatenating two images. After that created a Fully Connected Neural Network of 3 layers with LogSoftmax as the output function because it is a task of classification.
Used the two optimizers, SGD and Adam, both with and without momentum to train the model. It was observed that the highest accuracy was observed for SGD without momentum.
